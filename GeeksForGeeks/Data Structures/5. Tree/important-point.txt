// File Structure in Computers are example of Post Order Traversal
// Family Tree, Copy tree are example of Pre Order Traversal
// Inorder Traversal are limited to Binary Search Trees

//Worst case search complexity of BST is O(n) and for Balanced BST it is O(log n)

//Iterative tree search is more efficient on most computers

//Recursive tree search is more straightforward
