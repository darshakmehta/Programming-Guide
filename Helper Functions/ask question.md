3. What is the range of the elements of an array (2^32 / 2^64)

# Strings

1. Length of string
2. contents of string. 


## Think

1. If you are looking for unique characters think of checking the length if string contains 128/256 characters and requested string length is greater, terminate the code with flag = false.
2. It is easier to go from end of the string to the beginning


# Graph

- We will traverse all the node one by one for disconnected graph











# Think
